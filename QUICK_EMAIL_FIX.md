# ðŸ“§ Quick Email Setup Solutions for AgriVision

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Working Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use Temporary Email Service (Instant)**

For immediate testing, let's bypass email completely and use console logging:

```env
# Set this in your .env
EMAIL_SKIP_SENDING=true
```

### **Option 2: Use Gmail with Correct Settings**

Your current password `jmozcnaglmxlfali` might be:
1. Incorrect format
2. Old/expired
3. From wrong account

**Generate NEW App Password:**
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Select "Mail" â†’ "Other (Custom name)"
3. Enter: "AgriVision"
4. Copy the EXACT 16-character password

### **Option 3: Use Different Email Provider (5 min setup)**

#### **Outlook.com (Easiest)**
1. Create new Outlook account
2. Use these settings:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_new_outlook@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_outlook_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_new_outlook@outlook.com
```

#### **Yahoo Mail**
1. Create Yahoo account
2. Enable "Less secure apps" or generate app password
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_yahoo@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_yahoo_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_yahoo@yahoo.com
```
